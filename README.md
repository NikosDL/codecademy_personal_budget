# Personal Budget App

Code for the "Personal Budget" portfolio project from the Codecademy "Back-End Engineer" Career Path. 

### Basic Info about Project

The goal of the project is to create a web app for managing your personal budget according to the envelope system - each envelope dedicated to a specific type of expense (e.g. groceries, rent, etc.). 

This project started as an exercise on Express routing as part of the above mentioned course. I plan on expanding its functionality, as I learn about front-end development and database management until it's a fully functional web application - see below for the development Roadmap. 

### Installation

As of version 0.0.1 there is no frontend yet. To run the source code for the backend locally, the following dependencies are required: Node v22.2.0, Express v4.19.2.

### Current Branches

main: the main branch with a stable release
dev: the development branch where work for the next version is being done

### Roadmap

**0.0.1** (Current release) - Initial release with a functional API for the backend server
*0.1* (In development) - Basic frontend structure, connectivity between front- and backend
0.2 - CSS/JS for frontend, creation of signup/login structure on the frontend
0.3 - Migration of database to SQL, add signup/login functionality on the backend 
0.4 - Refactoring, optimization, revision of security, revision of documentation
0.5+ - ???
